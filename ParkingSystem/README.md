# Parking System LLD

A low-level design (LLD) implementation of a parking system in C# targeting .NET 8. This project demonstrates the use of various design patterns and principles to manage parking spots, reservations, and payments for different types of vehicles.

## Features

- Manage parking spots for two-wheelers and four-wheelers
- Create and manage reservations for vehicles
- Calculate parking fees based on different pricing strategies
- Process payments using different payment strategies
- Singleton pattern for managing entry and exit gates

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio 2022.
3. Build the solution to restore the dependencies and compile the project.

## Usage

1. Set up the parking system by creating a list of parking spots and vehicles.
2. Use the `EntryGate` class to book parking spots and create reservations.
3. Use the `ExitGate` class to calculate parking fees, process payments, and release parking spots.
