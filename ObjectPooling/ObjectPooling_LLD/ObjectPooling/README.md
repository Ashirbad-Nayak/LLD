# Object Pooling

## Description
Object Pooling is a design pattern that is used to manage the reuse of objects in order to improve performance and reduce memory usage. This project demonstrates the implementation of the Object Pooling pattern in a low-level design.

## Features
- Efficient object reuse
- Reduced memory allocation
- Improved performance

### Benefits of Object Pooling
- **Improved Performance**: By reusing objects, the overhead of object creation and destruction is minimized, leading to faster execution times.
- **Reduced Memory Usage**: Object pooling helps in reducing memory fragmentation and the frequency of garbage collection, resulting in more efficient memory usage.
- **Resource Management**: It provides better control over resource allocation and deallocation, ensuring that resources are available when needed.

### Use Cases
- **Game Development**: Frequently used objects like bullets, enemies, and particles can be pooled to enhance performance.
- **Database Connections**: Connection pooling is a common use case where database connections are reused to avoid the overhead of establishing new connections.
- **Thread Management**: Thread pooling allows for the reuse of threads, reducing the overhead associated with thread creation and destruction.
